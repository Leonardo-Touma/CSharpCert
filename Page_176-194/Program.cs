         Summary
            1. LINQ is a feature of C# that lets you work with different types of data and
            provides an easy and powerful way to write and maintain queries.
            2. LINQ Operators operate on sequences and offer flexibility to query data, such as
            filtering of data, sorting, etc.
            3. Aggregate functions are the functions that compute a query and return a single
            value.
            4. LINQ has two basic syntaxes: Query Syntax and Method Syntax.
            5. LINQ query consists of three main actions or steps: Obtaining of Data Source,
            Creation of Query and Execution of Query.
            6. There are two types of execution of LINQ query: Deferred and Immediate.
            7. LINQ to XML provides the facility to interact with XML data using LINQ query.
