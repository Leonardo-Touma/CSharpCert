      •	 Enum constant’s values can override with integer value.
      •	 Struct constructor must initialize all data members.
      •	 Default value of reference type is always Null.
      •	 Types defined with struct and enum are examples of value types.
      •	 Types defined with class, interface, and delegates are examples of reference type.
      •	 System.Object type is base class of all types in C# hierarchy.
      •	 Anonymous types must have one or more read only properties.
      •	 Dynamic types are useful for interacting with COM, DOM and Dynamic APIs.
      •	 Value type can store null when it is declared as nullable “?”.
      •	 Static types cannot be instantiated.
      •	 Static types only have static members.
      •	 Extension methods are only defined inside static class to extend the functionality of
          an instance type.
      •	 Special casting is required for explicit type conversion.
      •	 as operator is used to cast a type into another type.
      •	 User can write their definition for type conversion by using implicit and explicit
          keyword with special static methods.
