     Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is one of the three fundamental pillars of an object oriented program, which says, when data
    (attributes) and methods (behaviors) are defined in a single entity, it is called Encapsulation. It also refers to
    an object-oriented design principle called Data Hiding, which restricts the accessibility of data (attribute)
    and method (behavior) of an entity that are not necessary to its user.
    Encapsulation is implemented through two ways:
    1. Access Specifiers
    2. Data Protection
    Access Specifiers
    Access specifiers are special keywords, used to define the accessibility level of a type (class, struct, enum)
    and all of the data members and methods defined inside it.
    In C#, we have five kinds of access specifiers. Each access specifier defines a unique accessibility level.
    These access specifiers are:
    1. Public
    2. Private
    3. Protected
    4. Internal
    5. Protected Internal

            It is also used to declare abstract methods
            (method without definition) that when it inherits, it must be overridden by its derived classes.
