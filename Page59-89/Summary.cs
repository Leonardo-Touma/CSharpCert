            •	 C# has five access specifiers, i.e., Public, Private, Protected, Internal, Internal
            Protected.
            •	 Properties and Indexers both are used to encapsulate data.
            •	 Derived class can inherit all data from its base class, except one which is mentioned
            with private access specifier.
            •	 C# doesn’t allow multiple inheritance, but it allows multi-level inheritance.
            •	 A class must implement all members of an interface and all abstract methods of an
            abstract class.
            •	 Abstract method can only be written inside of an abstract class.
